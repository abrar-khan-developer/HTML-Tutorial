# HTML Tutorial

Welcome to my **HTML Tutorial** repository!  
This repo contains my learning practice and examples while studying HTML — the standard markup language for creating web pages.

## 📚 About
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all websites.  
In this repository, I’m learning and practicing the basic structure of web pages, including:

- HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting
- Links, images, and lists
- Tables and forms
- Semantic HTML elements
